# Body-Modelling-for-3D-Anthropometry

![creating by deform-based global mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1900zyh/3D-Human-Body-Shape/master/docs/dg-h.png)

This is my Dissertation artificat the goal of this model is to create 3D that could reshape accurate and realistic 3D human bodies from anthropometric parameters

### Different Mapping Methods
1. global mapping
2. [local_with_mask](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2758217)
3. [local_with_rfemat](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-8530-7_10)
